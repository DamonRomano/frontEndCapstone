  <p>You walk down the dusty path from your home near the edge of the village. 'Fore long, the path begins to trace the edge of a yellow wood. About a quarater-mile from home now and the path diverges; one road into the wood, th'other wraps back around to the crazy old milkman's place.</p>

  <p>Old fool's always singing at the top of his lungs about being rich while conspicuously NOT milking his damned cows.</p>

  <p>At any rate, you take the road less traveled-by, deep into the wood.  The road bends into the undergrowth.</p>

  <p>A bit after, you come upon the Home for Old Crones, a dilapidated neo-Colonial number with stereotypical flaking white paint and an even-more-stereotypical sense of foreboding.</p>

  <p>One particular crone separates herself from the what?... Gathering? Throng? Flock? What to they call multiple crones?</p>

  <p>Oh, that's right!  Murder!</p>

  <p>A murder of crones.</p>

  <p>Crone Prime looks about ready to speak to you, but pauses.  She looks with conspiratorial glee to her left...to her right. And then she opens her housecoat.</p>

  <p>"Hey, Stranger! Whadda ya buyin'?"</p>
