# **Bona Terra**
My capstone project for the first three months (the front-end portion) of my six-month, intensive, full-time, full-stack, developer bootcamp at Nashville Software School, *Bona Terra* is built using HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and AngularJS. It consumes the Weather Underground API and uses HTML5 geolocation.

*Bona Terra* is a minimalist, text-based, adventure...weather app. A simple, linear story exposes to the reader his current local weather conditions and a three-day forecast in a lighthearted, slightly surreal way. There may be obscure pop-culture references to the 1980s. 

##### Enjoy!
